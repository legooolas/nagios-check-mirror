nagios-check-mirror
===================

First commit made, with a moderately hacky example for Puppet using my horrible custom Nagios module.
(Soon to be replaced with something more sensible)

Set as GPL v3 but I grabbed the initial script this is based on from :

  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Mirrors/Monitoring%20Scripts

..which had no licence obviously specified, so I'm assuming that this is fine for now!
